Project MUMer is a simple command line program for demonstration of genome alignmet.

Whole program is written in Python 3.

The goal of the project is to demonstrate genome alignemnt process that uses 
advanced data structures and algorithms such SA-IS algorithm (suffix array - induce sorting) 
that creates suffix array in linear time, O(nlogn) longest common prefix computation, 
Smith-Waterman algorithm for local genome alignment and so on.
